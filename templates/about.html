        <h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>
    The <strong>Customer Sentiment Analysis Application</strong> is a graduation project designed 
    to help organizations understand customer opinions by analyzing written feedback in both English 
    and Arabic. The system uses keyword-based sentiment detection to classify feedback as 
    <strong>Positive</strong>, <strong>Negative</strong>, or <strong>Neutral</strong>, supported by 
    a scoring mechanism that reflects the strength of the sentiment.
</p>

<p>
    This application allows users to analyze a single sentence or upload a full text/CSV file containing 
    multiple customer reviews. The system processes each entry, detects sentiment, computes percentages, 
    and generates visual charts that help users understand overall customer satisfaction trends.
</p>

<p>
    The platform also includes user authentication, enabling each user to create an account, log in, 
    and review their personal history of sentiment analyses. This makes it suitable for businesses, 
    marketing teams, and researchers who need to track customer opinion over time.
</p>

<p>
    The project was developed following software engineering principles and meets the requirements 
    of the AOU graduation project, including system specifications, diagrams, usability, and 
    consistent design across all pages.
</p>

<p>
    Our goal is to provide a simple, accurate, and user-friendly tool that supports decision-making 
    by transforming unstructured customer feedback into meaningful insights.
